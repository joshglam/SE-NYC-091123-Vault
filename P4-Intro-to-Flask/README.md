<h1 align="center"><b>P4 Content Materials</b></h1>
<h4 align="center">For students of Cohort <b>SE-NYC-091123</b>.</h4>

## Summary ðŸ’¬

This subsection contains Phase 4 content for walking through newly curated primary lecture content for in-class activities.

**These notebooks are not a substitute or analog of the Phase 4 Canvas materials!**

Rather, they are a preferred resource for instructional walkthroughs of in-class content, with a particular emphasis on extending Python skills into the realm of backend development through learning Flask.

Many of the content materials are effectively tutorialized mini-projects that can be easily built out into larger scale projects once a more competent level of full-stack engineering skill has been attained.

---

Content in Phase 4 has been split into two major units: **core topical (primary) resources** and **special topical (subsidiary) resources**. 

**Core Topical (Primary) Resources** will prioritize introductory Flask concepts and techniques to get developers accustomed and familiar with design patterns and software engineering capabilities to ultimately encompass a comprehensive perspective in full-stack web app development. 

**Special Topical (Subsidiary) Resources** will extend core ideas with additional techniques, frameworks, and philosophies on Flask-centric patterns that will serve to level up developer projects into more professional-grade applications.
