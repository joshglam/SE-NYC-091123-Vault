    "Hiding unescessary code from the users. Think about the code that checks the banking information for their page. You don't want people to be able to access passwords in react. Sometimes its easier to put the code into the \"dog\" away from the owner. In building a game you wont see the code that sets the frame rate. you want the code to handle it in abstraction. If we build and abstract the righ way we can build it once and never have to build it again. It's similar to react in that reusibility way.\n",

I want it to inherit the things about the Dog class but there are other properties that are specific to other types of dogs. for example bloodhounds are big but a chihuahua isnt.
